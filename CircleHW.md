The goal is to create a class that represents a simple circle.

A Circle can be defined by either specifying the radius or the diameter, and the user can query the circle for either its radius or diameter.

Other abilities of a Circle instance:

Compute the circle’s area
- Print the circle and get something nice
- Be able to add two circles together
- Be able to compare two circles to see which is bigger
- Be able to compare to see if there are equal
- (follows from above) be able to put them in a list and sort them

You will use:

properties
- a classmethod
- a define a bunch of “special methods aka magic methods”


```python
from math import pi


class Circle:

    # constructor
    def __init__(self, the_radius):
      pass  
```
